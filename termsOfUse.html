			<p>
				The site is provided on an "as-is" and "as available" basis, and
				company and our suppliers expressly disclaim any and all warranties

			<p>
				To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall company or
				our suppliers be liable to you or any third-party for any lost

				resulting therefrom.
			</p>

				the contrary contained herein, our liability to you for any damages
				arising from or related to this agreement, will at all times be
				limited to a maximum of fifty U.S. dollars (u.s. $50). The existence

				our suppliers will have no liability of any kind arising from or
				relating to this agreement.
			</p>
			<p>

			<h2>Copyright Policy.</h2>
			<p>
				Company respects the intellectual property of others and asks that
				users of our Site do the same. In connection with our Site, we have
				adopted and implemented a policy respecting copyright law that
				provides for the removal of any infringing materials and for the
				termination of users of our online Site who are repeated infringers
				of intellectual property rights, including copyrights. If you
				believe that one of our users is, through the use of our Site,
				unlawfully infringing the copyright(s) in a work, and wish to have
				the allegedly infringing material removed, the following information
				in the form of a written notification (pursuant to 17 U.S.C. §
				512(c)) must be provided to our designated Copyright Agent:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>your physical or electronic signature;</li>
				<li>
					identification of the copyrighted work(s) that you claim to have
					been infringed;
				</li>
				<li>
					identification of the material on our services that you claim is
					infringing and that you request us to remove;
				</li>
				<li>
					sufficient information to permit us to locate such material;
				</li>
				<li>your address, telephone number, and e-mail address;</li>
				<li>
					a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the
					objectionable material is not authorized by the copyright owner,
					its agent, or under the law; and
				</li>
				<li>
					a statement that the information in the notification is
					accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are either the
					owner of the copyright that has allegedly been infringed or that
					you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Please note that, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), any
				misrepresentation of material fact in a written notification
				automatically subjects the complaining party to liability for any
				damages, costs and attorney's fees incurred by us in connection with
				the written notification and allegation of copyright infringement.
			</p>
			<h2>General</h2>

				These Terms are subject to occasional revision, and if we make any

				providing us with your most current e-mail address. In the event
				that the last e-mail address that you have provided us is not valid

				of the changes on our Site. These changes will be effective
				immediately for new users of our Site. Continued use of our Site
				following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement
				of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and
				conditions of such changes. Dispute Resolution. Please read this
				Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with
				Company and affects your rights. It contains procedures for
				MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</strong> All claims and disputes in
				connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service
				provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in
				small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an
				individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.
				Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be
				held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the
				Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees,
				predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all
				authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or
				goods provided under the Terms.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.</strong> Before either
				party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other
				party a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of
				the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the
				Company should be sent to: PO Box 431 Stn Main, Eastern Passage, NS
				B3G1A0. After the Notice is received, you and the Company may
				attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the
				Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days
				after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration
				proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may
				not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has
				determined the amount of the award to which either party is
				entitled.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Arbitration Rules.</strong> Arbitration shall be initiated through the
				American Arbitration Association, an established alternative dispute
				resolution provider that offers arbitration as set forth in this
				section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall
				agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR
				Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration except to the
				extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer
				Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at
				adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration
				shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or
				disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten
				Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through
				binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party
				seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the
				award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more,
				the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules.
				Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your
				residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and
				unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the
				U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the
				date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award
				rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
				jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater
				than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to
				the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater
				of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs and
				disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal
				share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.</strong> If
				non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall
				be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written
				submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party
				initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any
				personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise
				agreed by the parties.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Time Limits.</strong> If you or the Company pursues arbitration, the
				arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the
				statute of limitations and within any deadline imposed under the AAA
				Rules for the pertinent claim.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Authority of Arbitrator.</strong> If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator
				will decide the rights and liabilities of you and the Company, and
				the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or
				joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have
				the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any
				claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary
				damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to
				an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms.
				The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision
				describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award
				is based. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on
				an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The
				award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the
				Company.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL
				AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A
				JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall
				be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.
				Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient
				and less expensive than rules applicable in a court and are subject
				to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation
				should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal
				court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or
				otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL,
				instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</strong> All claims and disputes
				within the scope of this arbitration agreement must be arbitrated or
				litigated on an individual basis and not on a class basis, and
				claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or
				litigated jointly or consolidated with those of any other customer
				or user.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Confidentiality.</strong> All aspects of the arbitration proceeding shall be
				strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality
				unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a
				party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to
				enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek
				injunctive or equitable relief.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Severability.</strong> If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are
				found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of
				competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of
				no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the
				Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Right to Waive.</strong> Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth
				in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against
				whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect
				any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.
				<br>
				Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the
				termination of your relationship with Company.
				<br>
				Small Claims Court. Nonetheless the foregoing, either you or the
				Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.
				<br>
				Emergency Equitable Relief. Anyhow the foregoing, either party may
				seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in
				order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for
				interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or
				obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Claims Not Subject to Arbitration.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing,
				claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,
				and infringement or misappropriation of the other party's patent,
				copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this
				Arbitration Agreement.
				<br>
				In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement
				permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree
				to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within
				Netherlands County, California, for such purposes.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Site may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be
				subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You
				agree not to export, re-export, or transfer, directly or indirectly,
				any U.S. technical data acquired from Company, or any products
				utilizing such data, in violation of the United States export laws
				or regulations.
			</p>
			<p>

				(800) 952-5210.
			</p>

				<strong>Electronic Communications.</strong> The communications between you and
				Company use electronic means, whether you use the Site or send us
				emails, or whether Company posts notices on the Site or communicates
				with you via email. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to
				receive communications from Company in an electronic form; and (b)
				agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices,
				disclosures, and other communications that Company provides to you
				electronically satisfy any legal obligation that such communications
				would satisfy if it were be in a hard copy writing.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Entire Terms.</strong> These Terms constitute the entire agreement between
				you and us regarding the use of the Site. Our failure to exercise or
				enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a
				waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms
				are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
				The word "including" means "including without limitation". If any
				provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the
				other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid
				or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is
				valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Your
				relationship to Company is that of an independent contractor, and
				neither party is an agent or partner of the other. These Terms, and
				your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned,
				subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without
				Company's prior written consent, and any attempted assignment,
				subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing
				will be null and void. Company may freely assign these Terms. The
				terms and conditions set forth in these Terms shall be binding upon
